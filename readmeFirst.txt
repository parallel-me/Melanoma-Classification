--------Instructions to run----------


1. Run "FinalSVM.m" first.

2. First choose the Masks Directory (supplied in ZIP FILE) as prompted by the UI.

3. Choose the Lesions Directory (supplied in ZIP file) as prompted again by UI.

NOTE - MAKE SURE FILE NAME - 'ISIC_0000063.JPG' AND 'ISIC_0000063_SEGMENTATION.PNG' are not present in lesions and masks.
That single file is unable to be segmented using ROI. (Explained in report as exception).

4. The system runs for 2 minutes and after processing, Msgbox with specificity and sensitivity is displayed.

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO USE DATASET from ZIP FILE supplied. 
I have removed ISIC_0000063.jpg from masks and lesions.
